# quad-gy80
Quadcopter implementation using a gy-80 IMU. Control logic implemented in C++ and Arduino. I've tried to write all code myself from scratch, and so I've written a functional matrix library that assists the Kalman Filtering process work on multiple axes simultaneously. The development branch is primarily focused on testing the Kalman filtering and fixing any bugs there before moving on to motor control.
